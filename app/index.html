    <h2>Summer</h2>
    <p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling between spring and autumn. At the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.</p>
    <p>The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition and culture.</p>
    <p>When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>
